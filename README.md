# Git workshop prep

Hello! We’ll be running a git tutorial and workshop during Hack-Her-Thon 2021, and we’re looking forward to meeting you all. During the second part of the session, we’ll be walking through some git commands, which is something you can follow along interactively if you’d like. This is totally optional - you’re more than welcome to skip the below steps and watch along with the presenter - however if you would like to follow-along we recommend going through the below setup instructions before the session:

### Set up git
Whilst there are many different UIs built on top of git, for the purposes of this session we’ll be dealing with the command line interface (CLI). Check whether you have the git command line tools available by running `git --version` from PowerShell/Mac Terminal (press Windows+R and then run `powershell` to open a prompt if you’re running on Windows). If not, follow [the instructions on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#setting-up-git) to get git downloaded and installed.

### Create a GitHub account if you haven’t already
If you don’t already have an account on GitHub, sign up for one [here](https://github.com/join) (it’s free!). Be sure to check out the free [GitHub for Education pack](https://education.github.com/pack) as well if you haven’t already.

### Clone the Hello World repo
Make sure your setup is working properly by cloning the [octocat/Hello-World](https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World) repo using the following command:

```plain
git clone https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git
```

If all went well you should be able to open the cloned directory, and see the README file. If so - you’re all set up and ready for the session! If you ran into any issues with the above instructions - feel free to reach out to us on the event Slack before the session starts, or come along and watch.
